This uses ManimCommunity to start making the bits for a Math explainer video.
The goal is to create all the auto-created mp4 chunks here, and get them into iMovie
for final editing (adding music, voiceover, and video camera input).

3Blue1Brown is holding a competition to help make this kind of video, and probably manim specifically, take off in popularity.
